# Phenobarb Dataset

## Description
The Phenobarb dataset comprises 744 rows and 7 columns, collected from a pharmacokinetics study of phenobarbital in neonatal infants. It primarily focuses on the administration of phenobarbital to prevent seizures in newborn infants during the first few days of their life.

## Format
The dataset includes the following columns:

- `Subject`: An ordered factor identifying the infant.
- `Wt`: A numeric vector representing the birth weight of the infant in kilograms (kg).
- `Apgar`: An ordered factor indicating the 5-minute Apgar score, a measure of the health of the newborn.
- `Time`: A numeric vector showing the time when the sample was drawn or drug administered, in hours (hr).
- `Dose`: A numeric vector indicating the dose of drug administered in micrograms per kilogram (μg/kg).
- `Conc`: A numeric vector indicating the phenobarbital concentration in the serum in micrograms per liter (μg/L).

## Details
Data were collected during the first few days of life as infants received multiple doses of phenobarbital to prevent seizures. Blood samples were drawn at irregular intervals, and serum phenobarbital concentrations were determined.

This dataset has been analyzed in several studies, including Grasela and Donn (1985), Boeckmann, Sheiner, and Beal (1994), Davidian and Giltinan (1995), and Littell et al. (1996).
